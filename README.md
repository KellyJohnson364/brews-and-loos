# Good Brews and Neutral Loos

## Description
Welcome to Good Brews and Neutral Loos! In short, this web app provides users with information about local breweries and gender-neutral restrooms. Users can search for a city and be presented with a list of its breweries (provided by the Brewery DB API). Or, if they have a specific brewery in mind, they can search for a brewery using its name and the state it's located in. For each brewery in the search results, users will see the name of the brewery, its address, and a link to its website. They will also see either a message that indicates that the brewery has a gender-neutral restroom, or there will be a button users can click to see the nearest gender-neutral restroom to that brewery. Information on gender-neutral restrooms is provided by REFUGE Restrooms REST API.

Additionally, users can save search results in local storage, so they are able to safely perform other searches or navigate to other pages without fear of losing the breweries they were interested in.
